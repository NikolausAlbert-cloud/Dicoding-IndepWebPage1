            Solar power produced around 1.3 terrawatt-hours (TWh) worldwide in 2022, representing 4.6% of the world's electricity. Almost all of this growth has happened since 2010.[57] Solar energy can be harnessed anywhere that receives sunlight; however, the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed for electricity generation is influenced by weather conditions, geographic location and time of day.

              Humans have used wind energy since 3500 BC, initially for ships, windmills, and water pumps. Today, it mainly generates electricity through wind turbines, which range from 600 kW to 9 MW. Power output increases rapidly with wind speed, making offshore and high-altitude areas ideal for wind farms.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2015, wind power supplied nearly 4% of global electricity, with 63 GW of new capacity added. It was the top source of new capacity in Europe, the US, and Canada, and second in China. Wind met over 40% of electricity demand in Denmark, and around 20% in Ireland, Portugal, and Spain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wind energy has the potential to generate up to five times current global energy production and 40 times current electricity demand if all practical barriers are overcome. Achieving this would require large-scale deployment, especially offshore, where wind speeds are about 90% higher than on land, significantly boosting energy output.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2020, wind technology investments hit USD 161 billion, with onshore wind making up 80% of total investments from 2013 to 2022. Offshore wind investments nearly doubled to USD 41 billion between 2019 and 2020, driven by policies in China and growth in Europe. Global wind capacity grew by 557 GW from 2013 to 2021, with annual additions averaging 19% growth.

            Since water is about 800 times denser than air, even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea swell, can yield considerable amounts of energy. Water can generate electricity with a conversion efficiency of about 90%, which is the highest rate in renewable energy. There are many forms of water energy:

            Hydroelectric power has traditionally relied on large dams and reservoirs, which remain common in developing countries. Major examples include the Three Gorges Dam in China and the Itaipu Dam by Brazil and Paraguay.

          <h3 class="smallHydroSystem">Small Hydro System</h3>
          <p>Small hydro systems generate up to 50 MW and are used on small rivers or as low-impact projects on larger ones. China leads globally in hydroelectricity, with over 45,000 small hydro installations.</p>

          <h3 class="riverHydro">Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plants</h3>
          <p>
            Run-of-the-river hydro plants generate electricity without large reservoirs, using diverted river water to drive turbines. While some, like the Chief Joseph Dam, produce significant power, many are small-scale micro or pico hydro installations.
